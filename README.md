# doc-it

A ChatGPT based command line interface that automatically generates doc strings for your Python code.

## Requirements

To use this repository, you need  `setuptools` installed. You can install it using `pip install setuptools`. Make sure that you have the last version of pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`

## Gotcha

An unfortunate side effect is that using the this utility will create a New Chat every time ChatGPT is prompted.
